Write a JavaScript function that 
reverse a number.


Sample Data and output:
Example x = 32243;
Expected Output: 34223

---------------------------------------
               #HINTS               
---------------------------------------

we can't reverse a number directly.
reverse method only applied with an
array.

so we shoult convert this number into
an array

but we can't convert a number into array
so first we convert this number into a
string than convert this string into array
than we reverse it and convert it into
number
